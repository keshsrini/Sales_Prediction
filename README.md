## Introduction

Sales prediction is a common problem in retail and other industries where it's essential to forecast future sales for better inventory management, marketing strategies, and business planning. This project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict sales based on given datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or any other source. Ensure you have the following columns in your dataset:

- Date
- Store
- Item
- Sales

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd sales-prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Follow these steps to train and evaluate the model:

1. *Preprocess the data*:
   Ensure your dataset is clean and properly formatted.

2. *Train the model*:
   bash
   python train.py --data_path path/to/your/dataset.csv
   

3. *Evaluate the model*:
   bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/your/saved_model.pkl --data_path path/to/your/test_data.csv
   

## Modeling

The project includes several machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Features

- Data preprocessing scripts
- Training scripts for various models
- Model evaluation scripts
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of results
